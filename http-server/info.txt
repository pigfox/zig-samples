How to Run
----------
1. Save this code as `server.zig`
2. Compile and run: `zig run server.zig`
3. Access via browser at: `http://127.0.0.1:8080`
   or use curl: `curl http://127.0.0.1:8080`

Explanation
-----------
This code creates a basic HTTP server that:
1. Memory Management:
   - Uses GeneralPurposeAllocator for dynamic memory allocation
   - Properly cleans up with defer statements

2. Network Setup:
   - Listens on localhost (127.0.0.1) port 8080
   - Enables address reuse for easier restarting
   - Prints startup message to console

3. Connection Handling:
   - Runs infinite loop to accept connections
   - Processes each connection in handleConnection()
   - Reads HTTP request into 1024-byte buffer
   - Sends simple "Hello, World!" response with proper HTTP headers

Key Features
------------
- Error handling using Zig's `try` keyword
- Resource cleanup with `defer`
- Basic HTTP protocol compliance
- Simple single-threaded design

Limitations
-----------
This is a minimal example. A production server should add:
- Concurrent connection handling (threads/async)
- Proper request parsing
- Error page handling
- Configuration options
- Security features
